      For now on, since i started learning coding at Le Wagon, i wish to get a great job, one that brings me challenges to grow as developer
      and the resources to make my life easier and without big worries, as side project i want to get together my passions and abilities to create a agency of, as i call this: Digital Marketing Development
      this will give business/professionals the oportunity to have digital presence or a web-application they must need.
